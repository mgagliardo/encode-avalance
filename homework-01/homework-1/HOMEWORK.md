# Homework #1

Imagine you are designing a new blockchain system 

1. What behaviour  / aspects of the system do you want to encourage ?

* I would encourage trustability among the peers by using transparency, same as Bitcoin's blockchain I would allow users to be "vigilantes" and allow them to not trust, but verify. This means that all transactions are public and 

* Privacy would be another good point so pseudo anonymized data would be important as well. Addresses can be reused, however it would not be encouraged at all. By using hierarchical deterministic wallets, with a single seed users can create a master private key and from there child private and public keys.


2. What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to discourage ?

* To be honest I would not want to discourage any aspect, I would like the system to be as inclusive and allowed to anyone who wants to join in.

* However I understand there can be malicious agents that can try to inject poisonous data into the system, I would try to create a system similar to Proof Of Stake validation, so we can ban an agent from the network (probably with the agent's IP address).


3. What means do you have for this incentivisation?

* I am assuming here we are talking about a blockchain system for a cryptocurrency, and not for something like a company or government. If that is so, I would use the same proven system as Bitcoin, proof of work. So miners will be subsidized (rewarded) for their work. Still I would not know if if the amount of coins will be limited or not, I think I would say yes because I prefer the limited-model than the ethereum one of create/burn.
